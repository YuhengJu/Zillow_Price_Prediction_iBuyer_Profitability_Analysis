**Description**

Shopping for a home is usually a high-stake, time-consuming, stressful process, characterized by uncertainty and lack of transparency. Most buyers and sellers are involved in one of the largest one-time financial decisions of their lifetime, so getting a good estimate is critical. Buyers interested in a particular home need to invest time researching the recent prices of comparable properties and investigating the homeâ€™s specific features, such as how well it has been cared for, neighborhood noise, upcoming constructions, zoning changes, etc. At the same time, sellers need to set a price to attract buyers and hopefully facilitate the sale within a reasonable time frame.
