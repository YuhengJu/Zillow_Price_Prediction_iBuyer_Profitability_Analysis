**Description**

Shopping for a home is usually a high-stake, time-consuming, stressful process, characterized by uncertainty and lack of transparency. Most buyers and sellers are involved in one of the largest one-time financial decisions of their lifetime, so getting a good estimate is critical. Buyers interested in a particular home need to invest time researching the recent prices of comparable properties and investigating the home’s specific features, such as how well it has been cared for, neighborhood noise, upcoming constructions, zoning changes, etc. At the same time, sellers need to set a price to attract buyers and hopefully facilitate the sale within a reasonable time frame.

evaluated on the median error rate (MER), which is used by Zestimate to measure the predictive performance. The error rate is defined as

𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒=∣∣∣𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒−𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒∣∣∣
The median error rate is then defined as the median of the individual error rates across all properties. Note that MER may not be the loss function used in training your neural networks.
